# CSV-Editor

A short script I wrote for someone on UpWork to filter CSV files and then make changes to the values in a column and save to a new CSV file. It was a weirdly narrow request and the specific instructions on how the user should interact with the script makes me think it was for a university assignment. Nevertheless, here is the script.

The script is written in Python and uses the numpy, pandas and tabulate libraries. My first time using tabulate which makes tabular print to a terminal look nicer. I wrote the script in OOP and most of the work was catching every possible thing that could go wrong from interactions with the user.
